This app allows the user to censor the content in his browser.
The user may enter keywords into the local storage of the browser 
which the app will use as keys to look for before the browser is rendered. 
If any of the keywords are located the app will hide the parent div of the 
keyword. 

The ability to remove keywords is also available.
